1,1,0,"Pasta with Classic Tomato Sauce","Pasta al pomodoro",5,20,4,"<p>This sauce is the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">real</span> soul of Italian cooking. Simple, classic, it's the ""little black dress"" of Italian sauces, and it's used in much the same way as the American marinara. Unassuming yet flavorful, it is the starting point for endless variations and more complex recipes.</p><p>Every Italian family has its own recipe, but this version would make most happy. Here I use canned tomatoes, but you can substitute fresh tomatoes when they are ripe, flavorful and in season. Italians would use this amount of sauce for one and half boxes of pasta (approximately six servings).</p><p>I usually reserve one third of the sauce for another use, such as Red Scrambled Eggs, which you'll find in the variations following this recipe. But I've found many Americans prefer a richer dish, so feel free to use it all, my American friends! The sauce can be stored in the refrigerator for about a week, or frozen for about three months.</p>",tortellini.jpg,spaceport_wide-2.jpg,,"2011-06-16 14:37:15","2011-07-03 18:01:00"
2,0,1,"Spaghetti with Garlic, Olive Oil and Red Chili Pepper","Spaghetti aglio, olio e peperoncino",10,30,4,"Probably the most common spaghettata di mezzanotte, or &quot;midnight spaghetti&quot; dish, this recipe offers a clever solution to many situations, especially to the worst one: a last-minute party with an empty fridge. Do not underestimate this zingy sauce: it consists only of three ingredients, but the right balance among them is key.",,,,"2011-06-16 14:57:02","2011-06-16 14:57:05"
