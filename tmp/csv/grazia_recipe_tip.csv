1,1,"Double dose:","You can double the dose by using a big (28-ounce) can of tomatoes. To prepare the soffritto, use 2 tablespoons of butter, 3 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil and 1/2 onion. Add tomatoes and cook for about 20 to 25 minutes.","0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00"
2,1,"With garlic:","Use 1 clove of minced garlic instead of the onion. Italians rarely prepare this version because of their love-hate relationship with garlic. I personally prefer this recipe only for very specific dishes, like arrabbiata or the Sicilian pasta alla norma. For an &ldquo;in-between&rdquo; taste, use 1 thinly sliced shallot. With fresh tomatoes: Use the same weight of fully ripened, whole tomatoes, but remove the skins prior to use. To do this, poach the tomatoes in boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes, and then rinse under cold water. The tomatoes will then peel easily and can be chopped. For an even fruiter taste, make the soffritto with fresh spring onions.","0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00"
3,1,"With olives:","For a quick kick, add half a cup of pitted, medium, sliced green olives about 10 minutes before the sauce is ready.","0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00"
4,1,"Alla Nepenta:","A decadent, silky tomato sauce, obtained very simply by adding 1/4 cup of heavy cream to the sauce at the very end. My friend Giovanna, a true Milanese, told me this is the pasta they used to serve in the middle of the night at the Nepenta club, a very famous nightlife spot in Milano.","0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00"
5,1,"Alla Sorrentina:","Luscious, stringy, milky-sweet... After draining the pasta, quickly toss with tomato sauce and two diced balls of mozzarella.","0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00"
6,1,Baked:,"Voguish, intriguing yet sooo easy. Preheat the oven to 450o F convection. Drain the pasta 3 minutes in advance, and quickly mix with tomato sauce, two balls of diced mozzarella, 2 tablespoons of grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, 2 tablespoons of grated pecorino cheese and 1 tablespoon of butter. Pour into a nice-looking baking pan for serving at the table, sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of Parmigiano-Reggiano and 1 tablespoon of pecorino. Bake for about 8 minutes or until crunchy and browned on top.","0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00"
7,1,"With sausage (con la salsiccia):","Soul satisfying. Add one sausage, peeled and shredded, to the soffritto, and saute&rsquo; for an extra couple of minutes before adding the tomatoes. Red Scrambled Eggs: Add this sauce while scrambling eggs (one tablespoon of sauce for each egg).","0000-00-00 00:00:00","0000-00-00 00:00:00"
