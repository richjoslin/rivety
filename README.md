Rivety is a fork of the Communit.as open source social networking software platform which is no longer supported or available.

This system takes the Zend Framework to a place where it can be very quickly deployed as a website and customized to become anything you need it to be. The Zend 
Framework is great, but this gives you a huge development boost.

The following frameworks form the foundation for Rivety:
- Zend Framework
- Smarty
- jQuery

Rivety takes the following features of Zend Framework and puts them at your fingertips:
- Authentication
- Access Control
- Model-View-Controller architecture
- Template rendering (in this case using Smarty)
- Code Generation
- - Module Generator
- - CRUD-ifier - introspects a database table and automatically creates a model and forms to manage the data in that table (similar to Rails scaffolding).

WARNING:
Rivety has been dialed back to pre-alpha while I rework a few things. It's not yet fully ready for prime-time.
